        <h1>A Brief History of Coffee Shops</h1>
        <p>
            Coffee shops have been a beloved part of social life for centuries. The first coffeehouses are thought to have originated in the Middle East during the 15th century, particularly in the Ottoman Empire. Known as "qahveh khaneh," these establishments became hubs for intellectual discussion, debate, and community gathering.

            By the 17th century, coffee shops had spread to Europe, particularly in England, France, and Austria. In London, they were called "penny universities," where patrons could buy a cup of coffee for a penny and engage in stimulating conversations with scholars and writers.

            Today, coffee shops are everywhere—from small local cafes to global chains like Starbucks. They are places where people can work, socialize, or simply relax with a good book. Whether you're sipping an espresso in a quaint café or grabbing a quick latte on the go, coffee shops remain a significant part of daily life around the world.
