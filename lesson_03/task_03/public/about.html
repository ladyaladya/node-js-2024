        <h1>A Brief History of Cats</h1>
        <p>
            Cats have been living alongside humans for thousands of years. Domestication of cats is believed to have started around 4,000 years ago in ancient Egypt, where they were revered and even worshipped as gods. The ancient Egyptians kept cats as companions, but they also valued them for their ability to protect grain stores from mice and rats.

In the Middle Ages, cats were associated with superstitions, and some even believed they had magical powers. Despite this, they continued to be valuable companions in homes, helping to control pests.
